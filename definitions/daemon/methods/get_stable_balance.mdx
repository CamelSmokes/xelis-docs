### `get_stable_balance`

Same as `get_balance`, Get up-to-date asset's balance for a specific address.

The only difference is its searching first for:
- the latest balance with a output included (even in in unstable height)
- If not found, the latest available balance in stable height.

This difference is made so that ZK Proofs are less likely to be invalidated.
The reference (block hash, topoheight) is also included in the response.
