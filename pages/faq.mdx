# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This page will be updated regularly as more important questions are asked by the community.

## Wen launch, wen Mainnet, wen...?

The current target is **March 2024**; if we encounter any hiccups,
it could be later. Check for announcements on the official social channels to stay updated.

## What is XELIS?

It's a layer-1 private cryptocurrency blockchain. You can launch your own token or decentalized application.

## Is there any real world application of this?

Absolutely! There are a lot of tangible applications. One notable example is creating your own local currency foundation with peace of mind. 
No counterfeiting, no srutinizing eyes, 100% uptime, decentralized and secure transactions.

## What does "private" blockchain means?

The account balance are private. They are homomorphicaly encrypted.

## What is Homomorphic Encryption for dummies?

Perform computations on encrypted data without prior decryption; in this context,
it provides nodes the ability to validate transactions without ever knowing the balance 
of each participants.

## What is BlockDAG? Why is it used?

BlockDAG stands for Directed Acyclic Graph, a data structure designed to store blocks that differs from traditional blockchains structure.
Its key feature is the ability to insert blocks simultaneously, aiming to enchance scalability while mitigating centralization.
Various block types now exists, each distinguished by a unique topological height; however, it is possible for multiple blocks to coexists at the same block height.
Topo height /= Network height.

More info here: [BlockDAG](/features/blockdag).

## Why is XELIS an account-based model?

Account based blockchains offers way more advantages than drawbacks.
It's a more flexible system than traditional UTXO model, eliminating the need to follow inputs / outputs.
Node pruning is possible, removing old blocks while maintaining the verifiability of blockchain state.
Additionally, it enables a fast-sync feature - download the lastest state of the chain and join the network instantly.

More info here: [Features](/#main-features).

## How are you encrypting the balance homomorphicaly?

We use ElGamal with the Ristretto255 curve (~128 bits of security).
While homomorphic encryptions are generally computation-intensive, we only use addition and substraction.

## Is this a fork of an existing crypto project?

XELIS is **NOT** a fork. Everything is written in Rust from scratch using open source libraries.

## Was there any premine?

There is no premine or any allocation of coins whatsoever.
We have set a dev fee within the protocol for every block.

More info here: [Funding](/#funding).

## I saw Atomic Unit of 8 for the coin. What does that mean?

We store the balance as an unsigned integer to facilitate computations with encryption,
and the client shifts the balance by 8 decimals after decryption.

Ex: 100000000 = 1.00000000 XEL

## Will Testnet coins be transferred to Mainnet?

No! Coins will never be transferred or transferable from Testnet to Mainnet.
One network is for development, and the other is for the future of financial freedom.

## Is there any incentive toward minning or running a node in Testnet?

No immediate incentive is offered, but potential gifts may be given later down the road.
Being an early adopter, running a node, and participating in mining can help
us find bugs and move faster toward our goal of a stable running blokchain.
It benefits everyone involved in the project.

## What are your primary focus for the project?

  - Providing simple, functioning tools, up-to-date documentation, including easy-to-integrate APIs for devs.
  - A POW CPU/GPU friendly mining algo.
  - Decentralization, security and speed (no chain split, double spend, or any kind of network downtime).
  - Optimization (blockchain size, bandwidth transfer, transaction execution and encryption speed).
  - Community driven decisions.

More info here: [Objectives](/#objectives).

## What is the consensus algorithm that XELIS uses?

XELIS is a POW network. We are still currently working on a CPU/GPU friendly mining algorithm,
ASIC, and FPGA resistant.

## Does XELIS support Smart Contracts?

Yes, smart contracts are expressed using an interpreted language, known as XELIS-VM. 
The language has various primitives and features, such as recursive functions.
Functions are implemented with a configurable depth limitation to mitigate risk of network attacks and congestion.

More info here: [Smart Contracts](/features/smart-contracts).  
Github repo: https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-vm  

Please note the smart contracts are not currently available within the network.

## Some of the XELIS devs are contributors to Dero. What are the differences between both blockchain?

Here is a quick 1-to-1 table.

| Item                 | XELIS       | Dero (Stargate) |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Language             | Rust        | GO              |
| Blockchain structure | BlockDag    | Traditional (Sigma) |
| Mining algo          | ?           | AstroBWT3       |
| Avg time finality    | 15s         | 18s             |
| Dev fee              | % block fee | Premine         |
| Coin/Token decimals  | 8 decimals  | 5 decimals      |
| Balance encryption   | ElGamal (Ristretto) | ElGamal (BN256) |
| P2P protocol         | TCP (Tokio) | UDP (KCP)       |
| Storage              | Sled        | Graviton        |
| Total supply         | 18.4m       | 21m             |
| Smart Contract (VM)  | XELIS-VM    | DVM-BASIC       |
| Supply emission      | Curve       | 4 year halving  |
| Wallet registration  | Fee based   | POW (2m-2h)     |
| Addr mixins          | Transfers   | RingCT          |

However, it's worth nothing that there is a lot of aspects on each side that are not comparable.
