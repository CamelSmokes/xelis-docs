# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This page will be updated regularly as more important questions are asked by the community.

## What is XELIS?

It's a layer-1 private cryptocurrency blockchain. You can launch your own token or decentralized application.

## What is the ticker?

Ticker for XELIS asset is **XEL**.

## What is the main usage of XELIS?

It is used to pay fees, deploy Smart Contracts, create new assets, and store/transfer value.

## When is the mainnet launch ?

The current target is **March 2024**; if we encounter any hiccups,
it could be later. Check for announcements on the official social channels to stay updated.

## What is the estimated coin emission per year?

Here is the estimated circulating supply for the next 5 years:
- First year: ~2 831 221 XEL circulating supply
- Second year: ~5 226 799 XEL circulating supply
- Third year: ~7 253 766 XEL circulating supply
- Fourth year: ~8 968 841 XEL circulating supply
- Fifth year: ~10 420 016 XEL circulating supply

**NOTE**: Maximum supply is 18.4M XEL

## Is there any real world application of this?

Absolutely! There are a lot of tangible applications. One notable example is creating your own local currency foundation with peace of mind. 
No counterfeiting, no srutinizing eyes, 100% uptime, decentralized and secure transactions.

## Where are stored my coins ?

Your balance is stored on chain, not on your computer or in your wallet.<br/>
The wallet allows you to manage these funds as long as you have access to it.

Keep always your seed or a backup of your wallet file to keep access to your funds even if your device is lost.

## What does "private" blockchain means?

The account balance are private. They are homomorphically encrypted.
It is private for others people that don't have access to your account.

## What is Homomorphic Encryption for dummies?

Perform computations on encrypted data without prior decryption; in this context,
it provides nodes the ability to validate transactions without ever knowing the balance 
of each participants.

## What is BlockDAG? Why is it used?

A blockDAG stands for Directed Acyclic Graph, it differs from traditional blockchains structure.
Multiple blocks can now coexists at the same height with various types, but each can be distinguished by a unique topological height.

The primary reason for using this structure is to achieve fast block time validation; XELIS block time is ~15s.<br/>
The DAG significantly reduces the number of orphan blocks by merging them instead of creating split branches,
inherently enhancing scalability while mitigating centralization and chain split.

More info here: [BlockDAG](/features/blockdag).

## Why is XELIS an account-based model?

Account based blockchains offers way more advantages than drawbacks from our point of view.<br/>
It's a more flexible system than traditional UTXO model, eliminating the need to follow inputs / outputs.<br/>
It allows real fungibility of coins. 1 XEL = 1 XEL. No tainted coins.

Node pruning is possible, removing old blocks while maintaining the verifiability of blockchain state.
Additionally, it enables a fast-sync feature - download the lastest state of the chain and join the network instantly.

No need to full scan the chain to know your wallet balance, request the latest state and you're ready to use it.

More info here: [Features](/#main-features).

## How are you encrypting the balance homomorphically?

We use ElGamal with the Ristretto255 points on Curve25519 (which achieves ~128 bits of security).<br/>
While homomorphic encryptions are generally computation-intensive, we need to use addition and substraction for transactions.

## Is this a fork of an existing crypto project?

XELIS is **NOT** a fork. Everything is written in Rust from scratch using open source libraries.<br/>
If you want to know how the protocol work in details, start here: [Features](/#main-features).

## Why another crypto project?

Not the same vision as others, differents choices made, political reasons...<br/>
Cryptocurrency world is a whole new technology and continue to evolve each day, we want to be part of it by contributing to it.

## Did you already launched a project before XELIS?

No, none of us made a project before it, it is our first one.
But some of us may have participated / contributed to others projects as community developers.

## Was there any premine?

There is no premine or any allocation of coins whatsoever.
We have set a dev fee within the protocol for every block.

More info here: [Funding](/#funding).

## I saw Atomic Unit of 8 for the coin. What does that mean?

We store the balance as an unsigned integer to facilitate computations with encryption,
and the client shifts the balance by 8 decimals after decryption.

Ex: 100000000 = 1.00000000 XEL

Unsigned integer are used to have exact precision on addition / substraction in financial systems.<br/>
Try the following in Python to have an example of floating point issue: `3.33-3.13`

## Will Testnet coins be transferred to Mainnet?

No, coins will never be transferred or transferable from Testnet to Mainnet.<br/>
Testnet can be reset at any time and its coins have no value.

One network is for development, and the other is for the future of financial freedom.

## Is there any incentive toward mining or running a node in Testnet?

No immediate incentive is offered, but potential gifts may be given later down the road.
Being an early adopter, running a node, and participating in mining can help
us find bugs and move faster toward our goal of a stable running blockchain.
It benefits everyone involved in the project.

## What are your primary focus for the project?

  - Providing simple, functioning tools, up-to-date documentation, including easy-to-integrate APIs for devs.
  - A POW CPU/GPU friendly mining algo.
  - Decentralization, security and speed (no chain split, double spend, or any kind of network downtime).
  - Optimization (blockchain size, bandwidth transfer, transaction execution and encryption speed).
  - Community driven decisions.

More info here: [Objectives](/#objectives).

## What is the consensus algorithm that XELIS uses?

XELIS is a Proof-Of-Work (PoW) network. We are still currently working on a CPU/GPU friendly mining algorithm,
ASIC, and FPGA resistant.

The longest chain is the one selected by nodes, based on topoheight.<br/>
During chain split at same height, the main chain is selected based on the cumulative difficulty of each branch tip.

## Does XELIS support Smart Contracts?

Yes, smart contracts are expressed using an interpreted language, known as XELIS-VM. 
The language has various primitives and features, such as recursive functions.
Functions are implemented with a configurable depth limitation to mitigate risk of network attacks and congestion.

More info here: [Smart Contracts](/features/smart-contracts).  
Github repository: https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-vm  

Please note the smart contracts are not currently available within the network.
