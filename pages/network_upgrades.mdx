# Network Upgrades

The table below lists network upgrades, commonly known as hard forks, in the cryptocurrency world.
These updates are mandatory for all nodes and help to keep the network secure and up-to-date.
For a comprehensive list of past and frequent core updates, please refer to the [Gihub releases](https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-blockchain/releases) 
or [Git commits](https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-blockchain/commits/dev).

## V1

This is the first network upgrade, primarily aimed at adjusting the minning algorithm to be more egalitarian across devices
and enchance resistance against FPGAs.

The name of the new version of POW algorithm is [XelisHashV2](https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-hash).
Additionnaly, during V0, we could not get an accurate estimate of the current hashrate, because
the first algorithm was susceptible of producing low-bits hash result, resulting in higher than expected reported network hashrate.
This issue has been resolved with the new algorithm and is now a thing of the past.

Another mandatory has been introduced, increasing the extra data size limit per TX from 1 KB to 32 KB.
This allows to integrate more data in a single transaction, such as a document or a picture.
Limit per transfer in a TX is set to 1 KB.

Difficulty algorithm has been adjusted to be less aggressive and more smooth in its adjustment.
This will help to reduce the impact of hashrate fluctuations on the network and reduce the orphans blocks rate.

Last change done is in the internal storage of the versioned balances when a TX is executed.
We've discovered a front running issue that could happen during the build of several TXs but not all executed in the same block,
receiving an input during that lapse of time. The not-yet executed transactions were orphaned because the output balance was not updated.

The upgrade was scheduled to take place at block height 434100, approximately on July 11th, 2024.

## V0

This is the first version of the blockchain.
It was launched on April 20th, 2024, at block height 0.
