These updates are mandatory for all nodes. This does not include optional fixes and enhancements updates.
For a comprehensive list of past and frequent core updates, please refer to the [Gihub releases](https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-blockchain/releases) 
or [Git commits](https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-blockchain/commits/dev).

## V1

This is the first network upgrade, primarily aimed at adjusting the minning algorithm to be more egalitarian across devices
and enchance resistance against FPGAs.
The name of the algo is now [XelisHashV2](https://github.com/xelis-project/xelis-hash).
Additionnaly, during V0, we could not get an accurate estimate of the current hashrate, because
the first algorithm was susceptible to low-bits hash functions, resulting in crazy reported network hashrate.
This is issue has been resolved with the new algorithm and is now a thing of the past.


## V0

This is the first version of the blockchain. It was launch with a new algorithm named XelisHash.
