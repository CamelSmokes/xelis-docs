# XELIS Blockchain

XELIS is a blockchain made in Rust and powered by Tokio, using account model.
It allows deploy custom assets working exactly like the native coin in transactions and wallet.

This project is based on an event-driven system combined with the native async/await and works with a unique and from scratch p2p system.

## Network

- Expected Block Time is ~`15` seconds
- BlockDAG enabled
- Address prefix is `xel` on mainnet and `xet` for testnet
- Transaction fee is `0.01000` XEL per KB
- Full coin can be divided up to `5` decimals
- Maximum supply is set at `18.4` millions
- Maximum block size is set at `1.25`Â MB

## Objectives

The main objectives of XELIS are:

- Provide privacy on transactions / balances.
- Provide Smart Contracts support.
- Secure and fast.

Others objectives in mind are:

- Provide real custom assets working as the native coin.
- Designed as CPU/GPU mining friendly to improve decentralization as possible.
- Simple to use.
- Community driven decisions.

## Mini Roadmap

- Create a functional wallet (WIP)
- Include extra fees when sending coins to a not-yet registered address
- CLI Wallet
- Support of Smart Contracts (xelis-vm)
- Privacy (through Homomorphic Encryption)
