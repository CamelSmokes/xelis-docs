# XELIS Blockchain

A from scratch blockchain made in Rust and powered by Tokio, using account model.
XELIS is based on an event-driven system combined with the native async/await and works with a unique and from scratch p2p system.
This allow to be notified on any events happening on the network and to be able to react to them instead of checking periodically for updates.

BlockDAG is enabled to improve the scalability and the security of the network.
Homomorphic Encryption using ElGamal is used to provide privacy on transactions (transfered amounts) and balances.

ElGamal cryptosystem was choosen because it's a well known and studied encryption algorithm which has homomorphism features.
ElGamal is fast and is used in combination with Ristretto255 curve to provide a good level of security (~128 bits of security).
Homomorphic operations available using ElGamal are addition/subtraction between ciphertexts and/or plaintext and multiplication against plaintext value.

Account Model allows to have a more flexible system than UTXO model and to have a better privacy because there is no need to link inputs and outputs, which provide real fungibility.
It allows also the fast-sync feature to only download the last state of the blockchain instead of downloading all the history.

Pruning system is also available to reduce the size of the blockchain by removing old blocks and transactions.

We also aims to enabled Smart Contracts support in the future.

We provide different in-built networks:
- Mainnet: Not released yet
- Testnet: Running
- Devnet: this network is used for local development purpose where you want to create your own local chain. It has no peers

## Network

- Target Block Time is `15` seconds.
- Address prefix is `xel` on mainnet and `xet` for testnet.
- Transaction fee is `0.01000` XEL per KB but can be changed in future.
- Full coin can be divided up to `8` decimals.
- Maximum supply is set at `18.4` millions.
- Maximum block size is set at `1.25` MB.

## Objectives

The main objectives of XELIS are:
- Provide privacy on transactions / balances.
- Provide Smart Contracts support.
- Secure and fast.

Others objectives in mind are:

- Provide real custom assets working as the native coin.
- Designed as CPU/GPU mining friendly to improve decentralization as possible.
- Simple to use.
- Community driven decisions.

## Funding

XELIS is a community driven project and is not funded by any company or organization.
But to helps the development, the success and provide a better support of XELIS, we set a dev fee curve of `15%` on each block reward.

Current dev fee curve is as following:
- `15%` from block 0 to 1 250 000 (expected time is ~6 months with blockDAG)
- `10%` from block 1 250 001 to 3 000 000 (expected time is another ~6 months with blockDAG and network growing)
- `5%` from 3 000 001 until the project being developed and stable enough to reduce it.

**NOTE**: The dev fee will be redirected to a Smart Contracts once they are available.
We also have in mind to create a DAO to manage the dev fee and the project after few years.
