## Introduction

Homomorphic Encryption (also known under abreviation HE) is a form of encryption that allows computation on ciphertexts, generating an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the result of the operations as if they had been performed on the plaintext.
The purpose of homomorphic encryption is to allow computation on encrypted data without decrypting it.
The result of the computation is also encrypted, and can be decrypted to obtain the result of the computation on the plaintext.

Homomorphic Encryption allows to add privacy on transactions and accounts by doing computation while staying in encrypted form.
Each balances, transaction assets values are in encrypted form and nobody can determine the real value of it except involved parties.

## ElGamal

ElGamal is a public-key cryptosystem that is based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms. It was described by Taher Elgamal in 1985.

In XELIS, we use ElGamal to encrypt the data and perform operations on the encrypted data thanks of its homomorphic properties.
