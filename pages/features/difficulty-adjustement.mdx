title: Difficulty Adjustment

## Introduction

The difficulty adjustment algorithm is a key part of any blockchain protocol using Proof-Of-Work (PoW) consensus.
It is used to ensure that the time between blocks remains near the configured target block time as the amount of hash power on the network changes.
This is a crucial part of the protocol, as it ensures that the rate of new coins creation remains relatively constant over time.

This allows the network to remain secure, as the cost of attacking the network is directly related to the amount of hash power on the network.

The more we have a high hash power through several devices, the more the network is secure.

Having an efficient difficulty adjustment algorithm is crucial to the security and stability of the network.

## Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm

XELIS employs a streamlined version of the [Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter) to accurately estimate the network's hash rate based on the incoming block frequency.
This refined estimate is crucial for adjusting the difficulty target for each new block.

The advantage of using the Kalman filter lies in its ability to rapidly converge on the actual network hash rate while effectively filtering out misleading fluctuations caused by temporary hash rate spikes.

The difficulty is retargeted at every block and is based on the tips of block.<br/>
The parent difficulty is taken from the heaviest block's tip.
The heaviest block's tip selection is based on the cumulative difficulty achieved on its DAG branch.
It is used as the parent difficulty parameter for the algorithm.

To estimate the solve time of the block, we take the timestamp from the youngest block's tip available.
Youngest block's tip selection is based on the highest timestamp of all blocks tips.
It is used as the parent timestamp parameter for the algorithm which is then subtracted from the block timestamp to estimate the solve time.
