## Introduction

A **zero-knowledge** proof (also known under abreviation ZK Proof) is a cryptographic method that allows one party (the prover) to demonstrate knowledge of a specific piece of information to another party (the verifier) **without revealing** the actual information.

The proof assures the verifier that the prover possesses the knowledge without disclosing any details, ensuring privacy and security.

**XELIS** uses zero-knowledge proof to prove that a ciphertext (transferred amount which is in encrypted form) in a transaction is valid.
To verify such claims, we do two verifications:
- First, we verify that the transferred amount is **never** above encrypted balance.
- Second, the proof must assert that the ciphertext is **always** above-or-equal to zero.

For these two checks, we use [Bulletproofs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf), which is a non-interactive, zero-knowledge proof protocol and allows us to create two efficient range proof without any trusted setup.

We're making some optimizations in it to have a faster bulletproofs verification time, with plans to be below 1 ms.

## Optimizations

To have scalable and a fast way to verify all transactions included in a block, we can use batching/aggregate or pre-computed scalars.

## Front Running

Range proofs are based on the current final balance (in encrypted form) available during the transaction creation.
This is a necessary process to makes the assertions explained in introduction.

Because we need to integrate the balance ciphertext we have two potential problems.

### BlockDAG

As explained in the [BlockDAG](/features/blockdag) feature, XELIS has an unstable height and a stable height.
In the unstable height, blocks can be reordered based on their cumulative difficulty and thus, changes the order of transactions.

Alice creates a transaction to Bob and its transaction is integrated on the block ordered at topoheight 1000.
Bob send a transaction back to Alice using a part of coins received from her and is integrated in the block at topoheight 1001.
If the BlockDAG reorganize the order of the two blocks and switch their topoheight, Bob transaction would be orphaned.

Fortunately, the blockDAG take in count the TIPS of each block to create the topological order.
This means that, as long both transactions are integrated in the same chain (branch tip), they will be executed in correct order.  

### Incoming Transaction

Alice creates a ZK Proof with her current final balance ciphertext stored in chain.
Then, Bob sent her a transaction that will update her ciphertext balance.

In this case, Alice created a outdated ZK Proof because the transaction didn't got included before the Bob transaction.
The final balance used by Alice is not the latest anymore, this cause the transaction being rejected.

To solve this problem, we chose to make the verification of the transaction based on the latest balance that had a outgoing transaction.
So even if we receive incoming transactions between the time we create the Proof and the transaction is executed on chain, it will stay valid.

In details, newly created accounts will be based on their first balance when they do their first outgoing transaction.
We also set a limit to the use of the lastest balance with a outgoing transaction, we can use the last stable balance (which is in stable height of BlockDAG) if its higher.

This way, we have instant confirmation for coins and can be spend directly in the next block.
