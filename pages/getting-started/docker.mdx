**Docker** is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers.
It uses Linux containers to deploy applications to any machine and treat them as a single server.

In case you prefer to use Docker, we provide a Docker image for each software part.

## Docker images

### Daemon

The daemon is the software allowing to be a node and connecting to the network.

You can easily download the image from the Docker Hub.

```bash
docker pull xelis/daemon
```

### Wallet

The wallet is the software allowing to manage your wallet and interact with the network.

You can easily download the image from the Docker Hub.

```bash
docker pull xelis/wallet
```

### Miner

The miner is the software allowing to mine blocks and secure the network. It is part of the Proof-Of-Work consensus.
It must be connected to a daemon to work properly.

You can easily download the image from the Docker Hub.

```bash
docker pull xelis/miner
```
