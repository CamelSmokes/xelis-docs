## Start a miner

XELIS is a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain, meaning that miners are needed to secure the network and validate transactions.
In this guide, we will show you how to start a miner on the XELIS network.

XELIS Miner is a CLI (Command Line Interface) software in which you interact using the command line in a terminal.

### Requirements

In order to follow this guide, it requires that you already have the miner software on your device and a valid wallet address to receive your rewards in case of a block found and accepted by the network.

If you don't have one, please follow the [Create your wallet using CLI](/getting-started/guides/create-wallet-cli) page.

### Run the miner

<Steps>
### Open a terminal

Open a terminal on your device.

### Start the miner

Run the following command to start the miner:

On Windows:
```bash
xelis-miner.exe --wallet-address <your-wallet-address>
```

On Linux:
```bash
./xelis-miner --wallet-address <your-wallet-address>
```

Your wallet address should be replaced with your own wallet address.
It must be a valid XELIS wallet address in the network wanted.

For example, if you want to mine on the mainnet, you should use a mainnet wallet address.

### Monitor your miner

You can monitor your miner by checking the logs in the terminal.
It will show you the current status of your miner and if you found a block, if it is accepted or rejected and your current hashrate.
