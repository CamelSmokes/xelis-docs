# Tokenomics

## Max supply

XELIS has a fixed maximum supply of **18.4M** XEL.

## Mining reward

Mining block starts at around ~1.41 XEL and decreases each subsequent block. 
This reduction isn't based on halving logic but rather on the supply and emission factor of 20. 
It's also possible to mine a side block due to BlockDAG and receive a smaller portion of the reward.

Note: This table does not account for side blocks. As a result, the max supply may reach the 18.4M limit slightly sooner than expected.
